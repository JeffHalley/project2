Project Name: motorcycle proximity LED system

Student Name: Jeff Halley   Student ID: 20102427

  TODO: the main concept of this project is to mount a small electrical curcuit onto a motorcycle that will take a reading from a rear mounted ultrasonic distance sesnor and make an LED flash at a set speed depending on the range from the distance sensor. for example, if the distance being meassured is short the LED will blank rapidly.

Tools, Technologies and Equipment

1. Arduino 

2. Ultrasonic Sensor.

3. BreadBoard

4. 1 kohm Resistor.

5. cables/wires.

6. red LED.
